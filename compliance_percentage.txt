	/*
	We create two views: air_quality_compliance and emission_compliance. These views calculate compliance for air quality data and emissions data, respectively.

In the air_quality_compliance view, we join the air_quality table with the regulatory_standards table on the pollutant column to retrieve the regulatory standard for each pollutant. We then use a CASE statement to determine compliance status based on whether the concentration is less than or equal to the regulatory standard.

Similarly, in the emission_compliance view, we join the emission_records table with the regulatory_standards table to retrieve the regulatory limit for each pollutant. We use a CASE statement to determine compliance status based on whether emissions are less than or equal to the regulatory limit.
